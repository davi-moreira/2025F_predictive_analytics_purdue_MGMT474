    "text": "Assessments\nAs part of a university-wide initiative, the Business School has adopted an Official Grading Policy that caps the overall class GPA at 3.3. Final letter grades are determined by curving final percentages, subject to any extra-credit exceptions discussed in this syllabus. While you will see your final percentage in Brightspace, individual grade thresholds will not be disclosed before official submissions.\n\n\n\nAssessment\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nAttendance/Participation\n10%\n\n\nQuizzes\n20%\n\n\nHomework\n30%\n\n\nFinal Project\n40%\n\n\n\n\nAttendance and Participation\nAttend class, participate in activities, and complete any participatory exercises. Random attendance checks will be used to measure involvement. According to Purdue regulations, students are expected to attend every class/lab meeting for which they are registered.\n\n\nQuizzes\nRegular quizzes based on lecture material will be administered, with no drops. Due dates and details will be on Brightspace. Quizzes help reinforce content and maintain steady engagement.\n\n\nHomework\nHomework assignments offer practical, hands-on exposure to data mining tasks. Expect multiple-choice questions requiring analysis of provided results. Deadlines will be posted in Brightspace. These assignments are crucial for building technical and analytical skills.\n\n\nFinal Project\nIn groups, students will complete a practical predictive analytics project culminating in a poster presentation at the Undergraduate Research Conference. A comprehensive set of project guidelines will be provided, and the assessment structure will adhere to the following criteria:\n\nMilestone Deliverables (40%): Students will submit incremental project components on specific due dates. These deliverables allow for early feedback and ensure steady progress throughout the semester. Grades will reflect each milestone’s clarity, completeness, and timely submission.\nPeer Evaluation (20%): To encourage accountability and productive teamwork, students will evaluate their peers’ contributions. These assessments help ensure balanced participation and measure collaborative effectiveness.\nPoster Presentation at the Purdue Undergraduate Research Conference (40%): A poster template and assessment rubric will be shared, and you are encouraged to review previous award-winning student posters for inspiration. Your final posters must be submitted by the due date indicated in the syllabus, after which they will be printed and distributed during a dedicated Poster Presentation Preparation class. Additional details on the conference can be found at https://www.purdue.edu/undergrad-research/conferences/index.php. As the event may not coincide with our regular class time, please communicate with your other course instructors in advance regarding potential scheduling conflicts. If any issues arise, please let me know. We will not hold our usual class immediately following the Poster Presentation, allowing you time to rest and catch up on other coursework. Consult the course schedule for further details.\n\n\n\nGrade Challenges\nGrades and solutions will be posted soon after each assignment deadline. Students have 7 calendar days from the grade posting to submit any challenge (3 days for the final two quizzes and homework assignments). Challenges must be based on legitimate discrepancies regarding data mining principles or grading accuracy.\n\nReview posted solutions thoroughly.\n\nIf you suspect an error, email Dr. Moreira with:\n\nCourse name, section, and lecture day/time\n\nYour name and Student ID\n\nAssignment/Exam Title or Number\n\nSpecific deduction questioned\n\nClear rationale referencing solutions or rubrics\n\n\n\nNo grades will be discussed in-class. Please use office hours for clarifications. After the 7-day (or 3-day) window, grades are final.",
